# CollectdWin

CollectdWin is a MS Windows service which collects, aggregates and publishes both application and system metrics periodically. These application and system metrics can be used for performance analysis and capacity planning. CollectdWin is very similar to Collectd (https://collectd.org), it was developed because Collectd does not support Windows.
